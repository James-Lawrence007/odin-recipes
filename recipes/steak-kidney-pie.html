        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This steak and kidney pie is a meal in itself! Perfectly seasoned beef and potatoes simmer beneath a flaky crust for a comforting, hearty old-fashioned pie. I like to use milder flavored lamb kidneys instead of beef.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 pound fresh lamb kidneys</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons butter or lard</li>
                <li>2 pounds round steak, cubed</li>
                <li>2 onions, chopped</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon dried thyme</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1 bay leaf</li>
                <li>2 cups water, divided</li>
                <li>4 cups diced potatoes</li>
                <li>6 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 recipe pastry for a 9 inch single crust pie</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <!-- 1 -->
                <li>Remove fat and membrane from the kidneys; cut them in half and remove any white tissue in the center; dice into chunky pieces.</li>
                <!-- 2 -->
                <li>Heat butter or lard in a large pot over medium heat. Add diced kidney and steak; cook and stir until beef is browned. Stir in onions and season with salt, Worcestershire sauce, pepper, thyme, and bay leaf. Stir in 1 1/2 cups water; simmer until meat is almost tender, about 1 hour.</li>
                <!-- 3 -->
                <li>Add potatoes and continue simmering until potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes.</li>
                <!-- 4 -->
                <li>Whisk remaining 1/2 cup water and flour together until smooth; stir into beef mixture. Continue cooking and stirring until mixture thickens; transfer into a 3-quart casserole dish.</li>
                <!-- 5 -->
                <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
                <!-- 6 -->
                <li>Roll out pastry slightly larger than top of casserole dish; place pastry over meat mixture, and trim to leave a 1-inch overhang on all sides. Fold under, and flute against inside edge of casserole, then cut several slits in the crust to allow steam to escape.</li>
                <!-- 7 -->
                <li>Bake pie in the preheated oven until golden brown on top and filling is bubbling, about 30 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
